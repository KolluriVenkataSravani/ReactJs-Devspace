## This episode we will ignite or fire our app to make the production ready code
- create Reactapp - already ignited , it has all the super powers
## lets understand what happens and how to create own create react app - production ready app , instead of using already existing one
- npm - npm is everything except node package managerüòÇ --> go to npm official website and click on the ‚ù§ to see what npm is üöÄ
- npm manages packages but it does not stand for node package manager
- npm is a standard repository for all the packages, libraries, utilities are hosted over here
# How to make our project to use npm
1. npm init
2. give package name ( ex: namastereact1.0)
3. give description (optional)
4. give entry point - based on our project or else default
5. give test command - jest (used for testing)
6. give git repo
7. give keywords
8. give author : Sravani
9. give license : default
10. give : yes
- We will get a json file in our application (package.json)
- package.json is configuration for npm
- package.json also known as dependencies - our project depends on lots of packages
- npm take care of version of the packages in package.json

# What's a Bundler?
- Bundles or packages app properly so that it can be shipped to production
- create-react-app behind the scenes used webpack bundler,babel to build things
- webpack , parcel , veet : bundlers ( we will use parcel in our projects... why? our choice.. at the end every bundler plays the same role but different algorithms)

# Use of Parcel and how to install it into our app
- Parcel: easy to configure, one of the best libraries, ignites our app, if our app is a skeleton with bones-parcel will give muscles(strength) to our app
- Parcel comes as a node package
- Using npm, we can install parcel to our app easily
- Command: npm install -D parcel
- 2 types of dependencies our app can have:
    - 1. dev dependencies - generally required in a development phase
    - 2. normal dependencies - used in production also
- Parcel is installed as a dev dependency so we are using -D
-            "devDependencies": {
                "parcel": "^2.12.0"
            }
- ^ caret,~ tilde
- If we use ^ and if there is an upgrade in the version, parcel will be automatically updates its version to the new one
- If we use ~, it will install the major version
- It is safe to put ^
