## This episode we will ignite or fire our app to make the production ready code
- create Reactapp - already ignited , it has all the super powers
## lets understand what happens and how to create own create react app - production ready app , instead of using already existing one
- npm - npm is everything except node package manager😂 --> go to npm official website and click on the ❤ to see what npm is 🚀
- npm manages packages but it does not stand for node package manager
- npm is a standard repository for all the packages, libraries, utilities are hosted over here
# How to make our project to use npm
1. npm init
2. give package name ( ex: namastereact1.0)
3. give description (optional)
4. give entry point - based on our project or else default
5. give test command - jest (used for testing)
6. give git repo
7. give keywords
8. give author : Sravani
9. give license : default
10. give : yes
- We will get a json file in our application (package.json)
- package.json is configuration for npm
- package.json also known as dependencies - our project depends on lots of packages
- npm take care of version of the packages in package.json

# What's a Bundler?
- Bundles or packages app properly so that it can be shipped to production
- create-react-app behind the scenes used webpack bundler,babel to build things
- webpack , parcel , veet : bundlers ( we will use parcel in our projects... why? our choice.. at the end every bundler plays the same role but different algorithms)

# Use of Parcel and how to install it into our app
- Parcel: easy to configure, one of the best libraries, ignites our app, if our app is a skeleton with bones-parcel will give muscles(strength) to our app
- Parcel comes as a node package
- Using npm, we can install parcel to our app easily
- Command: npm install -D parcel
- 2 types of dependencies our app can have:
    - 1. dev dependencies - generally required in a development phase
    - 2. normal dependencies - used in production also
- Parcel is installed as a dev dependency so we are using -D
-            "devDependencies": {
                "parcel": "^2.12.0"
            }
- ^ caret,~ tilde
- If we use ^ and if there is an upgrade in the version, parcel will be automatically updates its version to the new one
- If we use ~, it will install the major version
- It is safe to put ^

# Diff b/w package.json and package-lock.json
- package.json - keeps the track of versions of the package installed in our system
- package-lock.json- keeps track of the exact version that is being installed
- package-lock.json has Integrity value which is a hash value which verifies that whatever is there right now in my dev machine is same as whatever version that has been deployed onto the production

# What's there in node_modules?
- node_modules contains all the code of all the dependencies that we fetched from npm
- transitive dependencies - for example parcel is our dependency and parcel might have other dependencies. So there are lot of code files in node_modules
- none of the node modules is a garbage , they are more important for the dependency
- Every node module installed has its own package.json, have its own depenencies , so our project will have multiple package.json files

# Should I push all this node_modules to github or production?
- Absolutely no
- put it inside .gitignore and put in it /node_modules

# Should I put package.json and package-lock.json in git?
- YES
- They maintain the note of what all dependencies are needed by our project with the exact versions
- If we have package.json and package-lock.json we can recreate all the node modules (npm install)
- Whatever we can regenerate no need to put it on github

# Igniting our App using Parcel
- npx parcel index.html      (npx parcel source_file of our project)
- parcel created a server for us and gave the port 1234 and it is hosting our app onto the server
- npm - to install package, npx - to execute package

# Installing react as a package in node_modules
- We have cdn links , but what if the react version gets updated , we need to change the links manually
to avoid such problem , we will install react pacakage from npm library using "npm install react"," npm install react-dom"
- We have installed react , now how to use that react in our code?
- import React from "react"; --> "react" :: this is the refernce to the react folder in node modules
- import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
- We installed react as a normal dependency
- In our HTML we are injecting App.js. It treats App.js as a browser script and a normal javascript file.
- Normal js file does'nt have any imports
- Solution:
    - We should tell it as a module
    -           <script type="module" src="./App.js"></script>

# Parcel🚀🧨 - Documentation(https://parceljs.org/)
- Creates a dev build,local server for us
- Automatically refreshes the page whenever we make a change to the code - HMR(Hot Module Replacement)
- Parcel uses a File Caching algorithm which is written in C++
- As soon as we save the file, it is building the server again with a reduced time because it is caching things in .parcel-cache file to give faster builds
- Parcel also does Image Optimization(most expensive thing in web browser is to load images into our page)
- Minification of our file during production build- bundles all our files for us(parcel is a bundler)
- Compress our file(removes white spaces, reduces size for easy sharing)
- It does Consistent Hashing, Code Splitting(splits files), Differential Bundling(Supports Older Browsers - App can be opened inside diff browsers even older versions- parcel takes care of all that)
- Diagnostics - Error Handling(Beautiful Error Display View)
- Right now our app is hosted on HTTP, Parcel also allows us to host it on HTTPS
- Zero config tool - very simple
- Tree Shaking - In our whole code if we have 100 functions and we are using 4-5 functions, parcel will remove unused code for us(extra random code)
- It also has Lazy mode
- npx parcel index.html --https (To open in HTTPs mode)
- Creates diff dev and production bundles(production build takes more time due to more optimizations)

# How to create PROD build?
- npx parcel build index.html (add build to get PROD Build)
- We will get an error because we have main:App.js in package.json but we are specifying index.html in parcel command , so remove main in package.json
- Remove main from package.json since it is mentioning the entry point as App.js but we are giving index.html in command
- Where does the build goes? It will go into the dist folder
- When parcel generates a dev build on port 1234 it puts it in dist folder
- When we build a prod build, it is generated in the dist folder
- Delete dist folder and do a prod build, it will take more time than the dev build

# When we open and see the files in dist folder
- index.html, index.js, index.css etc we will see that code is something not understandable because parcel compress the code, minify the code and remove all the white spaces, it also change the names of variables to compress the code
- Those 3 files except map files - those are the production ready code files and they contain all the code in them
- This prod build is a highly optimised build which we can push onto production and serve this app to the users - fast,better performance,optimised

# Can we push parcel-cache,dist onto git?
- NO
- They can be regenerated so not required to push to github
- In our local we have code and we put it onto github repository and it is deployed on a server
- Here local is not directly conneted to server. Server fetches this code from github and will host the app to end user
- All the commands that we write in our local will run in our server also
- Our code has its own package.json,node_modules
- We will push only package.json to github and it is used to install node_modules
- The copy of node modules in local is different from server nodemodules
- Server has its own dist,parcel-cache,node_modules folders using npm install

# Lets make our app compatible for the old browsers !! 🌐🔥 (https://browserslist.dev) --> we can also give country specific also
- In package.json add browserslist - it will take array of browsers
-           "browserslist": [
                "last 2 Chrome version",
                "last 2 Firefox version"
            ]
- It doesn't mean that it won't work on other browsers - it might or might not work in other browsers
- But for the browsers we mention it will work 100%
