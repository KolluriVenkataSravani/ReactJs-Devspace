- Write the command in the script so that it will start executing the command using npm
-           "scripts": {
                "start":"parcel index.html",
                "build":"parcel build index.html",
                "test": "jest"
            },
- Now we no longer have to write the whole command npx parcel index.html etc
- Run it using npm run start(can also give npm start), npm run build( no shortcut for this)
- npm run start //it wll call parcel index.hmtl
- npm run build - it will build our project for production
- npm run start -- shortcut npm start

# JSX
- JSX is a syntax which makes it easier to create react elements
- JSX is not a part of react
- JSX is not HTML inside Javascript
- JSX is a HTML like or XML like syntax
- JSXHeading that we create in App.js is a react element
- With Core React we create react elements in this way , but this is not user read friendly
-           const heading = React.createElement(
                "h1",
                { id: "heading_start" },
                "start"
            );
- To make it user friendly we use jsx syntax
- JSX IS JUST A SYNTAX , at the end it is a react element which is js object
-           const jsxHeading = <h1 id="heading">I am heading from the JSX , makes your life easy </h1>

# How JSX code is executed?
- JS Engine doesn't understand JSX
- JS Engine understands ECMAScript6(ES6)(Pure Javascript)
- Then how does JS Engine understand JSX? Because of Parcel. The code is transpiled before it goes to JS Engine. JS Engine gets the code that browser can understand
- Parcel doesn't do this transpilation. It gives this work to the package Babel.
- As soon as I save the file, Babel transpiles(converts) the code quickly into browser understandable format.
- Babel- JavaScript compiler
- JSX code is transpiled to React.createElement(JS Object)=>Rendered as HTML element onto the DOM
- If we want to give attributes in JSX we need to give camelcase (className, tabIndex)

# Single line JSX
-           const heading = <h1> this is JSX </h1>;
# Multiple line JSX
- Wrap the code inside round brackets
-           const heading = ( <h1>
                this is jsx multiple line syntax
            </h1>);
- We need to wrap the jsx code in paranthesis() to make babel understand where the jsx code starts and where the code ends

# React Components
- Everything in react is a component
- React components - 1. Class based Component - OLD Way of writing code
                     2. Functional Component - NEW Way of writing code

# React Functional Component
- Name the react component with a capital letter or else we will get error
- Functional component is a normal JS Funtion which returns a JSX(React Element)
-           const Heading= () =>{
                return <h1> This a React functional component heading</h1>
            };
- Other way
-           const Heading1= () =>(
                <h1> This a React functional component heading</h1>
            );
-           const Heading1= () =>(
                <div id="container">
                    <h1> This a React functional component heading</h1>
                </div>
            );
- We cannot render a functional component using root.render
- root.render is only for react elements not for functional components
- root.render(<HeadingComponent />); //This is how we can render functional components
# Component Composition
- Rendering one func component in another func component:
-           const Title= () =>(
                <h1 className="head" tabIndex="5">
                    Namaste React Using JSX
                </h1>
            );
            const HeadingComponent= () =>(
                <div id="container">
                <Title /> //composition
                    <h1 className="heading">Namaste React Functional Component</h1>
                </div>
            ); 
- We can also write it like a normal function
-           const Title= function(){
                return(
                    <h1 className="head" tabIndex="5">
                        Namaste React Using JSX
                    </h1>
                );
            };
# Amazing super power of jsx- {}
- If we put {} inside the JSX code, we can run any js expression
-           const number=10000;
            const HeadingComponent= () =>(
                <div id="container">
                <h2>{number}</h2>
                <h1>{100+200}</h1>
                <h2>{console.log("abc")}</h2>
                    <h1 className="heading">Namaste React Functional Component</h1>
                </div>
            );
# How to put React element inside React component?
-           const HeadingComponent= () =>(
                <div id="container">
                {jsxHeading}
                    <h1 className="heading">Namaste React Functional Component</h1>
                </div>
            );
- Cross site scripting attack- read cookies, get data etc
- JSX can escape from this attack by sanitizing data(JSX is powerful)
- Attacker can send any malicious code and get the access to the information of our laptop if we run any api kind of thing
- But this will he handled by jsx {} - these braces will sanitize everything we Pass in , so that nobody can do anything using loop hole , react and JSX will handle this situation
- We can also run a function inside Component
-           const Title= () =>(
                <h1 className="head" tabIndex="5">
                    Namaste React Using JSX
                </h1>
            );
            const HeadingComponent= () =>(
                <div id="container">
                {Title()}
                <Title />
                <Title></Title>
                    <h1 className="heading">Namaste React Functional Component</h1>
                </div>
            );
