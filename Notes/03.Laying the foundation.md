- Write the command in the script so that it will start executing the command using npm
-           "scripts": {
                "start":"parcel index.html",
                "build":"parcel build index.html",
                "test": "jest"
            },
- Now we no longer have to write the whole command npx parcel index.html etc
- Run it using npm run start(can also give npm start), npm run build( no shortcut for this)
- npm run start //it wll call parcel index.hmtl
- npm run build - it will build our project for production
- npm run start -- shortcut npm start

# JSX
- JSX is a syntax which makes it easier to create react elements
- JSX is not a part of react
- JSX is not HTML inside Javascript
- JSX is a HTML like or XML like syntax
- JSXHeading that we create in App.js is a react element
- With Core React we create react elements in this way , but this is not user read friendly
-           const heading = React.createElement(
                "h1",
                { id: "heading_start" },
                "start"
            );
- To make it user friendly we use jsx syntax
- JSX IS JUST A SYNTAX , at the end it is a react element which is js object
-           const jsxHeading = <h1 id="heading">I am heading from the JSX , makes your life easy </h1>

# How JSX code is executed?
- JS Engine doesn't understand JSX
- JS Engine understands ECMAScript6(ES6)(Pure Javascript)
- Then how does JS Engine understand JSX? Because of Parcel. The code is transpiled before it goes to JS Engine. JS Engine gets the code that browser can understand
- Parcel doesn't do this transpilation. It gives this work to the package Babel.
- As soon as I save the file, Babel transpiles(converts) the code quickly into browser understandable format.
- Babel- JavaScript compiler
- JSX code is transpiled to React.createElement(JS Object)=>Rendered as HTML element onto the DOM
- If we want to give attributes in JSX we need to give camelcase (className, tabIndex)

# Single line JSX
-           const heading = <h1> this is JSX </h1>;
# Multiple line JSX
- Wrap the code inside round brackets
-           const heading = ( <h1>
                this is jsx multiple line syntax
            </h1>);
- We need to wrap the jsx code in paranthesis() to make babel understand where the jsx code starts and where the code ends
