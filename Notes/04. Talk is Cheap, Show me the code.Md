- Inline style css is not a prefered way to write code
- Inline style css can be written in the JSX code like a javascript object
-           const StyleCard= {
                backgroundColor: "#f0f0f0"
            }
- Calling the css like this:
-           <div className="res-card" style={StyleCard}>

# Props(Properties)
- Props are used to pass data to a component dynamically
- Props are normal arguments to a function
- Destructuring on the fly:
-           const RestaurantCard= ({resName,cuisine}) =>{
                return(
                    <div className="res-card" style={StyleCard}>
                        <img className="res-logo" alt="res-logo" src="https://media-assets.swiggy.com/swiggy/image/upload/fl_lossy,f_auto,q_auto,w_264,h_288,c_fill/j88ngtan5pxib04das3y"></img>
                        <h3>{resName}</h3>
                        <h4>{cuisine}</h4>
                        <h4>4.1 stars</h4>
                        <h4>45-50 Mins</h4>
                    </div>
                )
            }

            const Body= () =>{
                return(
                    <div className="body">
                        <div className="search">
                            Search
                        </div>
                        <div className="restro-container">
                            <RestaurantCard resName="Ghuma Ghumalu" cuisine="Biryani, Andhra, Asian" />
                            <RestaurantCard resName="KFC" cuisine="Burger, Fast Food" />
                        </div>
                    </div>
                )
            }

# Config Driven UI
- Our website is driven by data(configs)
- Controlling how the UI looks like using config. Config comes from backend
- Based on the location, data and UI changes accordingly in Swiggy
- UI Layer + Data Layer = Frontend

- Array.join(", ")   This is used to get the cuisines values as comma seperated
- Use Functional Programming in React(Map, Filter, Reduce)
-           {resList.map((restaurant) => (<RestaurantCard resData={restaurant}/>))};

# Question: Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop
# Solution: Whenever we are looping onto anything we have to mention the key which must be unique. Why?
- React doesn't uniquely identify each item. Whenever a new Restaurant card comes above the first restaurant card, it will clean the container and re-renders all cards again because react doesn't know which card is added newly
- But if we give a key to each Restaurant card like restaurantId, it is unique. So react exactly knows which ids are already there. So it will only render the new id. This is a huge optimisation.


-           {resList.map((restaurant, index) => (<RestaurantCard key={index} resData={restaurant}/>))};
- Index can also be taken as key which starts from 0
- But react itself says don't use index as the key if we have changing data
- not using keys(not acceptable)<<<< index as key <<<< unique id(best practice)
