# Export and Import React Components
Export: In that particular file
-           export default Header;
Import: Where we are using it
-           import Header from "./components/Header";
                                or
            import Header from "./components/Header.js";
- Never keep hard coded data in components folder

- 2 ways of export and import:
    1. default export
    2. named export
    3. default import
    4. named import
- In a single file, i can only have one default export
- If we have multiple components to export, use named export
- Named export- write export infront of the variable names

Export of multiple components using named export:
-           export const CDN_URL="...";
            export const LOGO_URL="...";
Import of named export:
-           import { CDN_URL } from "../utils/constants";

Default export,import:

    export default Component
    import Component from "path"

Named export,import:

    export const Component
    import {Component} from "path"
