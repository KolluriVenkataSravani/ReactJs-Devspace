# Export and Import React Components
Export: In that particular file
-           export default Header;
Import: Where we are using it
-           import Header from "./components/Header";
                                or
            import Header from "./components/Header.js";
- Never keep hard coded data in components folder

- 2 ways of export and import:
    1. default export
    2. named export
    3. default import
    4. named import
- In a single file, i can only have one default export
- If we have multiple components to export, use named export
- Named export- write export infront of the variable names

Export of multiple components using named export:
-           export const CDN_URL="...";
            export const LOGO_URL="...";
Import of named export:
-           import { CDN_URL } from "../utils/constants";

Syntax:

        Default export,import:

            export default Component
            import Component from "path"

        Named export,import:

            export const Component
            import {Component} from "path"

# State Variable- Super Powerful React Variable
- We use React Hooks called useState to create state variable
- React Hooks - A normal js function(utility function) given to us by react which is prebuilt
- 2 important hooks
    1. useState()- used to create super powerful react variables
    2. useEffect()
- Import useState as a named import
- useState()-
    - used to create State Variable
    - it maintains the state of the component
    - local state Variable scope is inside the component
    - const [resList] = useState([//pass default value]); //Local state variable creation syntax by react
    - let resList ; //noraml Js variable creation
- To modify the resList
    - Use a function , the function comes as second parameter in the array
    - const [resList , setResList]= useState([{Defaultdata}]);
- Whenever a state variable updates, react will re-renders the components
