# Monolith Architecture
- Traditionally when web apps are developed , they all are developed using monolith architecture
- Suppose we have huge project
  - We have everything in the same project (API Code , Ui code , Auth code, DB code, Notifications code)
  - If we want to change anything in the project for even small modifications like button color , we need to recompile the project , and redeploy the project , very big task
  - Only one stack should be used for whole project

# Micro Service Architecture
- Different services for diff jobs
- For each and every thing we will have different projects -> This is known as seperation of concerns 
- Follows the single responsibility principle(every sevice have their own job)
- We can have different tech stacks for each service(Advantage)

# How do these services interact each other?
- Ui needs to contact Backend and Backend to DB and Back end to Auth
- All the services Run on their own sepcific ports
  - And all the ports(1234,5500,1000 etc..) are mapped to domain name (/,/api,/sms)

# How web apps fetch data from backend?
Method 1:
- As soon as our page loads, we can make an api call and when we get the data we can render it onto the UI
- Supose api call takes 500ms , our page will wait for 500ms and then render the UI
- Page loads->API call->Render onto UI

Method 2:
- As soon as our page loads, we will just render our UI, now we will make an API call
- As soon as we get the data, we will re-render the page again
- Page loads->Render->API call->Re-render

#
- In react we will always use Method 2
- Method 2 gives better UX
- In method 1, till 500ms(till api call time) we will see blank page which is bad UX
- In method 2, we will render something and after api call we will load data, which is a good UX
- No matter how many times we render, method 2 is better (React have faster render cycle)
