# Monolith Architecture
- Traditionally when web apps are developed , they all are developed using monolith architecture
- Suppose we have huge project
  - We have everything in the same project (API Code , Ui code , Auth code, DB code, Notifications code)
  - If we want to change anything in the project for even small modifications like button color , we need to recompile the project , and redeploy the project , very big task
  - Only one stack should be used for whole project

# Micro Service Architecture
- Different services for diff jobs
- For each and every thing we will have different projects -> This is known as seperation of concerns 
- Follows the single responsibility principle(every sevice have their own job)
- We can have different tech stacks for each service(Advantage)

# How do these services interact each other?
- Ui needs to contact Backend and Backend to DB and Back end to Auth
- All the services Run on their own sepcific ports
  - And all the ports(1234,5500,1000 etc..) are mapped to domain name (/,/api,/sms)
