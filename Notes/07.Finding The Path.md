# Routing of react application using diff routes
- npm install react-router-dom
- createBrowserRouter creates route configuration
- Configuration means some information that tells what will happen on a specific browser route
- Ex: If i am calling about, what will happen in that url
- createBrowserRouter takes a list of paths
- Path is an object
- Ex: If my path is / load the home page(AppLayout). If my path is about, then load about us page
- RouterProvider will provide the routing configuration to our app
- Outlet will fill the children according to the path. It is like a tunnel where all the children go inside and appropriate one will be filled according to the path
- Creating child routes and loading them using outlet
- Never use an anchor tag to redrirect to a new page because it reloads the entire page
- In react we can use link component to redirect without loading the entire page
- This is why react applications are called single page applications
- Behind the scenes Link is using anchor tag- We can seee that in html code when we inspect

# 
- 2 types of routing we can have in our application(for web apps):
    1. Client Side Routing
        - No network calls
        - Just loading the component as we are having everything ready
        - Single Page Applications
        - We are using this
    2. Server Side Routing
        - Using anchor tag, reloads the entire page by making a network call to the server
