# Discussion about class based components
- Class Based Components-Older way of creating components
- It is a normal javascript class
- Functional Component is a function which returns a piece of JSX
- Class based component is a class which has a render method which returns a piece of JSX
- Class based component is converted into HTML and rendered onto browser
- We create a state variable in class component by using this.state in the constructor
- We need to use constructor to pass the props
- We need to write always super(props);
- The super() method calls the constructor of the parent class. This is important because it ensures that the parent class is properly initialized.
- The super() method can also be used to pass props to the parent class. Props are arguments that are passed to a component from its parent.
- We need to use this.props.name to get rendered
- This props can be accessed any where in the component
- Never update state variables directly

# Lifecycle of React class based component
- How this class based component is mounted in react?
- Basically Parent compoenent rendered or mounted on the webpage, it start rendering jsx and then when it see a class componen then it starts to load classComponent now
- When the execution started, a new instance of class is created. Then the constructor is called. After constructor, then Render is called
- Flow of calling :::
    - parentconstrucor
    - parentRender
    - child constructor
    - child Render

- componentDidMount: Method given by class component::: First constructor and render is called and once this class based component is there on DOM then this componentDidMount will be called --> Life cycle of react
- When component is mounted successfully, componentDidMount is called
- When parent is loaded , constructor is called and then render is called and it will go to child class based component and it will trigger its life ccycle
- Now child comp constructor is called
    - childern render will be called
    - children mount will be called (once child mount is completed)
    - parent did mount will be called
- componentDidMount --> is used to make api calls
- React does not wait for the api call to give data back and then render
- Instead react will load , render and make an api call and fill the data

# If there are multiple children?
- Order will change , because react will optimize
    - parent constructor
    - parent render
        - first child constructor
        - first child render
        - second child constructor
        - second child render
        - < DIFF IS CALCULATED BETWEEN THE VIRTUAL DOMS-RECONCILIATION>
        - < DOM MANIPULATION - IN SINGLE BATCH> batches the render phase of children together
        - first child component did mount
        - second child component did mount
    - parent component did mount

# Phases in React Component Rendering
1. Render Phase- constructor, render
2. Commit Phase- react updates DOM, componentDidMount
- Render Phase is batched together for children
- Commit phase is also batched together after render phase
- So the componentDidMount is called for both the children together(commit phase) after the render phase(constructor, render)
- Render phase is very fast, commit phase takes time
    - It will call render phase for child 1
    - It will call render phase for child 2
    - It will call commit phase for child 1
    - It will call commit phase for child 2
- DOM manipulation is very very expensive. So react tries to batch up render, commit
- Why react is batching up in the render phase?
    - Once the commit phase start, react DOM manipulation will start
    - DOM manipulation is one of the most costly operation which will take time
    - Render phase is soo fast, so it will batch
    - Then the commit phase will happen-> expensive operations(DOM manipulation)
- Mounting cycle will finish once the component is renderred with dummy data
