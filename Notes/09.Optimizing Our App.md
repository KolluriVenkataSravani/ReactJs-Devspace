# Single Responsibility Principle
- If we have any function or class it should have single responsibility
- Each component has its own responsibility(Modularity) -> it should do it work
- Modular Fashion -> Break code into more modules
    - Becomes more Testable
    - Becomes more reusable
    - Becomes more maintainable
    - We can catch and fix bugs easily, if we have more small modules

# Custom Hooks
- Makes our code readable, maintainable and modular
- Special javascript function given to us by react
- Hooks are Utility Functions. They are like helper Functions
- Abstracting the logic to custom hook
- Best practice to create custom hook in UTILS
- File name name as use.js -> react will know it is a hook if we write "use" at start
- Using custom hooks will make more testable -> if there is any issue , like fetching ,we can directly fetch that logic
