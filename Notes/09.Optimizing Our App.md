# Single Responsibility Principle
- If we have any function or class it should have single responsibility
- Each component has its own responsibility(Modularity) -> it should do it work
- Modular Fashion -> Break code into more modules
    - Becomes more Testable
    - Becomes more reusable
    - Becomes more maintainable
    - We can catch and fix bugs easily, if we have more small modules

# Custom Hooks
- Makes our code readable, maintainable and modular
- Special javascript function given to us by react
- Hooks are Utility Functions. They are like helper Functions
- Abstracting the logic to custom hook
- Best practice to create custom hook in UTILS
- File name name as use.js -> react will know it is a hook if we write "use" at start
- Using custom hooks will make more testable -> if there is any issue , like fetching ,we can directly fetch that logic

# How to increase our app performance?
- Bundler --> Bundels all the js files(maps the js files) and makes a single js file and give it to browser
- Problem in developing large scale app :
    - The size of the JS file will increase a lot based on the number of components it holds
    - We should optimize this to make our app perform good
    - Possible solution:
        - Break our app into multiple small pieces(into multiple smaller javascript files) i.e, smaller bundles of these files
        - This process is know as CHUNKING or CODE SPLITTING OR DYNAMIC BUNDLING or LAZY LOADING or DYNAMIC IMPORT
        - Due to that js file will not get heavy
- LazyLoading or OnDemandLoading: We will not load everything directly, but when we go to that page, then we will load that code when required
- How to Achieve?
    - By importing components in a different way
    -           const component = lazy()
    -           const Grocery = lazy(() => import("./components/Grocery"));
    - Above line makes a seperate bundle for the component
    -           < Suspense fallback=>{} >< component/></ Suspense> //fallback is used when component code is missing , then fallback will be loaded
- Use lazy loading to split the large scale app into multiple chunks of bundlers to increase the performance of the app -> all code will not load at once, code will be loaded on demand
- When we are using lazy loading, while the page that we are moving to takes time to load, it will show error. At that time, we can use suspense with a fallback to display a shimmer ui or loading message. Refer to the code in App.js
