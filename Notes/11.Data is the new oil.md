# Higher Order Components
- Function that takes a component and returns a component
- Takes an existing component, enhances it, and returns back a new,modified component
- Lets build veg feature in swiggy app

# Controlled and uncontrolled components
- Important part of react app is managing its data
- Ui is very static , it doesnt have logic of its own
- UI and data are different layers -> UI layer is powered by Data Layer
- Datalayer contains -> states , props, local variables
- UI layer -> JSX code which is changed by data layer

# How do we manage the whole data properly?

### Controlled Components -
- If the parent component have full controll to the child components i.e, child should not have its own state, it should depend on the parent component
- We can control via props
### Uncontrolled components -
- When it have its own state then it is an uncontrolled component
- If it manages itself, then it is uncontrolled

- WE NEED TO LIFT THE STATE UP , TO CONTROLL THE CHILD COMPONENTS

# Props Drilling
- When REACT APP grows big, there will be multiple components and nested components
- Passing data btw components is very challenging
- React has one way data flow (Top to bottom)
- Suppose if we have to pass the data from parent to some 10th child, then it will be very difficult to pass data from parent to children as the data goes from each intermediate component. This is called PROPS DRILLING
- We can overcome by using React Context (Super power given by React)
- React context is a place where data is stored

# React Context
- When we use react context we can avoid props drilling (Randomly passing the props everywhere)
- context - Place where we keep global data and anywhere we can access that data
- Global data examples - Logged in user, Theme(light or dark - we need it everywhere in our app)
-           const UserContext = createContext({
                loggedInUser: "Default User",
            });
-           const { loggedInUser } = useContext(UserContext);
- Can we keep all the data in context?- If we feel that we use that data in multiple places, then we can keep in context
- Anywhere in the app, we can use context provider, we can override the default value (if we wrapped the whole app in context provider, then everywhere the value changes)
- Context is a global space, we can provide for the whole app or a part of the app, and we can override the default data
