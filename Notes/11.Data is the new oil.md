# Higher Order Components
- Function that takes a component and returns a component
- Takes an existing component, enhances it, and returns back a new,modified component
- Lets build veg feature in swiggy app

# Controlled and uncontrolled components
- Important part of react app is managing its data
- Ui is very static , it doesnt have logic of its own
- UI and data are different layers -> UI layer is powered by Data Layer
- Datalayer contains -> states , props, local variables
- UI layer -> JSX code which is changed by data layer

# How do we manage the whole data properly?

### Controlled Components -
- If the parent component have full controll to the child components i.e, child should not have its own state, it should depend on the parent component
- We can control via props
### Uncontrolled components -
- When it have its own state then it is an uncontrolled component
- If it manages itself, then it is uncontrolled

- WE NEED TO LIFT THE STATE UP , TO CONTROLL THE CHILD COMPONENTS
