# Redux Toolkit
- React and redux are different
- Redux offers easy debugging
- How to manage state of application
- How to manage data layer of our application
- React works in UI layer of react app
- Redux works in Data Layer of react app
- Using redux from start is not mandatory along with react from start of building the application
- Redux is used when lots of data is transferred between components or if there are more read and write operations
- All the applications built with redux can also develp with out redux
- Redux is not a part of react, redux is seperate library, which we install in our project and we use in our project
- Redux is not the only library that we use for state management there are other libraries too , which do the same thing
- Zustand --> another library use for state management

### Other Libraries from the Redux Team
- React-Redux --> Official React bindings for Redux
- Redux Toolkit --> Toolset for redux development

## Architecture Of REDUX - Scenes behind Redux ToolKit
- REDUX STORE IS LIKE A BIG JS OBJECT KEPT IN A GLOBAL CENTRAL PLACE
- Is it good to keep all the data in the one big object? YES
    - We can make slices of the redux store
    - Slice is a small portion of redux store
    - Examples: To keep data seperate we make logical seperations -> slices
    - Card data slice, user data slice, themes data slice...
- Suppose if we want to add an item to cart, we cant directly modify cart
- There is a process
    - When user clicks add button it "DISPATCHES AN ACTION" and calls a FUNCTION, this function (reducer function) will internally modify the cart
        - it will update the slice of the redux store
        - This function is basically known as REDUCER
        - The whole above process is writing the data
    - How to read the writtedn data?
        - We use the SELECTOR to read the data from the slice of redux store, and selector will give the data
        - When we use the selector, it is known as SUBSCRIBING TO THE STORE (It means, it is SYNC with the store)
        - It will update the cart with the data that is read
        - (Cart will be subscribed to redux store with the help of a selector)

- To connect redux store with react , react the app with < Provider store={appstore}> .......app...
- Steps to do:
    1. Install @reduxjs/toolkitand react-redux
    2. Build our store
    3. Connect our store to our app
    4. Slice(cartSlice)
    5. dispatch(action)
    6. Selector
- npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
- npm install react-redux
- Now we will create slices (cart slice)
- And then create reducers with state and action, payload is the data
- Dispatch an Action
-           const dispatch = useDispatch();
            const handleClearCart = () => {
                dispatch(clearCart());
            };
### IMPORTANT
- Whenever we are using useSelector, make sure you are using the right portion of the store
-           const cartItems = useSelector((store) => store.cart.items); //subscribing to store using selector
- Whenever anything changes in the store, and if the whole store is subscribed, then the component will be effected, so it gives less performace
- Always subscribe to the small part of the store , for better performance
- OlderRedux => Never Mutate the state and returning was kind of mandatory
- ReduxToolKit => You have to mutate the state -> returning is not mandatory
- Redux toolkit behind the scenes uses "IMMER"
- IMMER -> Takes the existing state and the new state and calcualtes the difference and gives the new state to redux
- Redux Tool kit -> either mutate the existing state or return the new state(replace whatever is there in the original state)
